## 🧠 About the Game

This is a simple beginner-level game made using Unity.  
It includes:  
- A **Main Menu** with a Play button.  
- A **Main Arena (Level 1)** where the actual gameplay happens.  
- Functional player movement (using WASD / Arrow keys).  
- Basic collisions, lives, and scoring system.  
- A Game-Over state and restart option.

The goal of this project was to **understand the Unity workflow**, including:  
- Scene management  
- Scripting (C# basics)  
- Player controls  
- Camera setup  
- Building for PC

## 🧑‍💻 My Personal Experience

This was my first time using Unity, and honestly, it felt magical!  
I started with no prior Unity knowledge—just a few tutorials and curiosity. Within 4 hours I:  
1. Created my **Main Menu** and **Main Arena** scenes.  
2. Added a **Play button** that switches scenes.  
3. Designed basic player controls and movement using C# scripts.  
4. Handled collisions and basic score logic.  
5. Finally, built my first working game and tested it on my laptop!

I faced challenges like:  
- Camera not following the player properly.  
- Buttons not responding initially.
- Also the text and canvas issue 
- Game starting directly without the menu scene. (I fixed it using ctrl+ shift+b then i did some changes put main menu on top and then main game )
- Also sometiimes i forgot to add scripts in different objects and thinking a lot why it isnt working though everything was correct lol

But fixing these issues helped me understand **how Unity scenes, UI buttons, and GameObjects interact**.  
Now I feel confident to build more polished and advanced games in the future—this was truly the best start to my game-dev journey 🚀

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Unity is all about **experimentation** — don’t be afraid to break things.  
- Start small and focus on **getting things to work**, not perfection.  
- Always **test scenes separately** before combining.  
- And most importantly: **Enjoy building games!** 🎯
